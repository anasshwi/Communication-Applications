Project: http proxy client
cproxy.c: implementation of constructing a request, connecting to the server and recieving a respond and saving it in it's directory.

Description:
cproxy is a simple C program designed to act as a basic HTTP proxy. It allows users to retrieve files from remote web servers using HTTP GET requests and saves them locally.
If the requested file is already present in the local filesystem, it serves the file directly without requesting it from the server again.

Features:
HTTP GET requests: Supports sending HTTP GET requests to remote servers to retrieve files.

Local caching: Checks if the requested file is already present in the local filesystem. If found, serves the file directly from the cache.

Port handling: Parses URLs to extract the port number, if specified, for establishing connections.

Error handling: Provides error handling for various scenarios such as socket creation, connection establishment, file operations, and memory allocation.

Command-line options: Supports an optional command-line argument (-s) to open the downloaded file using the default system application.

Usage:(write in terminal)
./cproxy <URL> [-s]
-s : open the path (optional)

URL Format:
http://hostname[:port]/path/to/file

Note:

This proxy only supports HTTP GET requests.
Error messages will be displayed if any issues occur during execution.
Ensure proper permissions and network connectivity for successful operation.
